# text-diff-version

I want a textbox and a "version history" on the left, see screenshot

I want to show the diff compared to the last version inline, with red for "removed" characters and green for added characters.

I think we need the diff npm package.

When user clicks "accept", a new version will be created, and comparison will switch to latest version

Use localstorage for versions for now
